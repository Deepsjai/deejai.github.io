        		<h1>Hi, This page is all about me.  !</h1>
				<p>I hate to admit it, but I am in this obsessive state of making myself a great person each day. This website is for measuring growth. I have written journals before and one thing I got to learn from them is how I have grown. I want to motivate myself everyday to become a lot better than the previous day and one day die knowing a lot of stuff about this universe. After all we are lucky that we have life to experience this wonderful universe and know about it. so keep enjoying this hilarious journey. </p>
